Hi! Welcome to my personal website. Originally built as a static html page in a Google Bucket, now ported to Next.js and hosted on Vercel.

## Running the Website

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
